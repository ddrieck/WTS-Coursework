	<center><h1>Question 1</h1></center>
	<p>I currently use Firefox 17.0.1 and will continue to use it for the course. I will use it on various systems, but all will be using Windows 7 64-bit. I have used Firefox for many years and am very comfortable with it's layout, shortcuts, and add-ons. I'm an especially big fan of the built in tab grouping functionality (useful when you regularly have 50+ tabs open) and the element inspection tool. The reading describes Firefox as a good developer's browser and I will continue to use it in that role. Chapter 3 also has several good recommendations for add-ons, such as Firebug, which I will add and use during the length of the course. </p>

	<p>Without the novalidate attribute my browser, which is HTML5 compatible, reads the form tag and uses HTML5 validation on the form. This gives me the small drop down on the field asking me to fill it out. Alternately with the novalidate attribute added to the form tag the browser is instructed to ignore the built-in HTML5 validation. Javascript validation then takes over and presents the alert box that was written in login.js, instead of the drop down.</p>
